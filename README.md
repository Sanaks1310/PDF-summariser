# PDF Summarizer is a web-based application built using Python and Streamlit, integrated with Google's Gemini API. The application is designed to simplify document analysis by enabling users to:
• Upload PDF files or enter raw text
• Automatically generate concise summaries of the content
• Ask context-specific questions related to the uploaded material
• Receive accurate answers powered by Gemini's language model

The goal of this project was to explore the practical application of large language models (LLMs) in real-world use cases such as document summarization and interactive Q&A systems.

This project deepened our understanding of AI model integration, prompt design, and the deployment of AI-powered interfaces. It was an enriching experience applying machine learning concepts to solve practical problems.
